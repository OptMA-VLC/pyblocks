# Example 2: Calculator

In this tutorial you will learn:
- How to implement a block
- Reading inputs and writing outputs
- Getting parameters from the user

In this example we will implement a block that performs arithmetic operations on two inputs `a` and `b` and 
produces an output `result`. The operation to be performed is configured through the parameter `operation`.
